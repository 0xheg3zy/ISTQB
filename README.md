# Objectives of Testing
  
## Evaluation
- Understand requirements, user stories, designs, and code.

## Finding Defects
- Execute test cases to break the system and catch bugs.

## Ensure Required Coverage of Test Object
- Ensure no untested areas will cause problems.

## Reduce Risk of Inadequate Software Quality
- Minimize bugs, delays, and system failures.

## Ensure Requirements Have Been Fulfilled
- Verify that the software meets all specified requirements.

## Test Object Compliance with Standards
- Ensure software follows standards such as:
  - ISO rules
  - Privacy laws
  - Accessibility guidelines
  - Security standards

## Validating the Test Object
- Recognize that software may not exactly match requirements.
- Ensure the software solves the customer's actual problem.

## Typical Objectives of Testing
- Ensure the system performs as intended and satisfies user needs.

# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- Ensures **quality**, **functionality**, and **requirement fulfillment**.

# Detecting Errors and Failures

## Errors
- **Definition:** Mistakes made by system analysts or customers, not always developers.
- **Reasons:**
  - Time pressure
  - Human error
  - Inexperienced staff
  - Miscommunication between team members
  - Complexity
  - New technologies
  - Poor team coordination

## Defects
- Issues in software functionality, such as:
  - **Functional defects** (e.g., miscalculation in financial software)
  - **Non-functional defects** (e.g., slow system performance, limited users)

## Failures
- Failures caused by **environmental conditions**, such as:
  - Pollution
  - Radiation
  - Electromagnetic interference

# False Positives in Testing
- A false positive occurs when an issue is detected but is actually incorrect.
